SOAP Goals
----------
Extensibility - can be adapted to any business process
Neutrality - used with http(s) , compatible with ftp,smtp
Independence - no lock-in to vendors, operating systems or languages.
-------------------

SOAP 1.1 (2000) still in use

SOAP 1.2 (2007)
clearer processing extensibility models and better web integration.
----------------------

role of soap libraries. ( free of serialization and deserialization )

As a developer - we need a library compatible with our system.
Indicate which service we want to use by providing a document in xml format known as WSDL
then we call remote services just as we call local functions

messages are sent as envelopes.
these are request response or fault messages.

data is parsed by client library and returned to local environment as native data.

Disadvantage is SOAP Size.
message translations take time due to size.
