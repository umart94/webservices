anything under web inf is protected from direct access from a browser.

create a new folder views under web inf
then create a jsp file.



https://localhost/servletprint/WEB-INF/views
https://localhost/servletprint/views

whatever is the path of that views directory of web inf directory

WE CANNOT ACCESS WEB INF FROM BROWSER.

we want to put views there, so it wont be accessed by browser

but our servlet will route /forward to the views

so only through our servlet class we can AND SHOULD access the views.


datafiles
web xml file
java classes and servlets 

that we do not want to pe public will go in web inf directory.
