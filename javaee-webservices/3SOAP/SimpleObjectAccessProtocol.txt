this is closely related to wsdl, most wsdl documents are based on soap
wsdl documents refer to soap as part of their bindings

soap messages transmit effectively over http
soap is universally recognizted, full support , language independent and platform independent , communcating through xml.

soap - toolkit for java

java api for xml web services
jax-ws
defines a standard java to wsdl mapping which automatically translates java code to a wsdl message using soap protocol

jax-ws is a protocol that automatically generated the wsdl file.

java ee platform already includes jax-ws
jax api is already core api that glassfish uses.





RPC - Remote Procedure calls
----------------
used to communicate between objects over a distributed component object model so network computers can communicate between a series of software components.
another common standard use is common object use broker architecture

rpc is designed for computers within a small network. ( dont work well on http messages )

firewalls and proxy servers block rpcs due to security risk and not all computers can run rpcs without substantial modification.
