Creating a JDBC Resource

Your Java application will usually reference a data source object to establish a connection with the database. This needs to be created first using the following procedure.

Using the navigation tree in the GlassFish Administration Console, navigate to Resources, JDBC, JDBC Resources. A list of resources will be displayed in the JDBC Resources frame.

Click New. The New JDBC Resource frame will be displayed.

In the JNDI Name field, enter the JNDI name that will be used to access this resource, for example enter jdbc/MySQLDataSource.

In the Pool Name field, select a connection pool you want this resource to use from the drop-down listbox.

Optionally, you can enter a description into the Description field.

Additional properties can be added if required.

Click OK to create the new JDBC resource. The JDBC Resources frame will list all available JDBC Resources.
