Securing Web Services

Only authorized applications can access web services
Prevent Non-authorized people to not access the web service. and sniffing web traffic

------------------------

1. Use an HTTP Server that supports Encryption.

since most webservices exchange messages in plaintext ( the http requests , http headers and request bodies. and response messages in form of xml or json )

an encryption scheme sends these in non readable format.

HTTP Servers and Clients Encrypt and Decrypt Messages.

--------------------------------------
SSL - Secure Sockets Layer

a cryptographic protocol for encrypting streams of data over the internet.
netscape , 1995
2.0 in 1996
its supported by all modern http webservers and clients.

-------------------
TLS - Transport Layer Security.

its based on SSL
1.1
1.2

-------------------
HTTPS - Secure HTTP
combination of http requests and responses over SSL/TLS channels

ssl/tls establishes a secure bi-directional tunnel for data transfer between 2 hosts
data in plaintext made binary , sent from client to server , decrypted. and response goes through same procedure.

All modern HttpServers support HTTPS

we need a Security Certificate to implement HTTPS on a WebServer.

these certificates are acquired from : 
1. DigiCert

DigiCert is a trusted certificate authority.
it is also a Root certificate authority.


1. CLIENT NEEDS A ROOT CERTIFICATE
2. THIS MATCHES THE certificate OFFERED BY THE HTTP SERVER
3. THE ROOT CERTIFICATES ISSUED BY THESE VENDORS KNOWN AS ROOT CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE WEB CLIENTS


get a security certificate
install in the httpserver

only drawback is a slight reduction in performance.
