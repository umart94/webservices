associated with service integration bus

single architecture
communication network for multiple servers and other devices

different services are bus stops
single architecture
can pickup services from each bus stop and transmit them to the other bus stop

any application that is connected to a service integration bus
can exchange messages with other application by defining a destination

one application sends to  destination and the other receives from it
i.e (producer and consumer application) can produce and consume regardless of the messaging engine that they used to connect to the bus

helps to increase compatibility

messages can be sent asynchronously
message will be retained in the bus


advantages
compatibility - multiple messaging engines. makes it easier to translate amongst different types of web services.

flexibility - asynchronous messaging, deal with different levels of server load in web applications

control

convert internally hosted web services to web services and vice versa.
