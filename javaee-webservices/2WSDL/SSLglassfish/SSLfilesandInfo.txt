1. Key Pairs
2. Keystores / Truststores
3. Encryption
4. Client Cert Authentication

key pairs are made up of public keys and private keys

1. public key is used for encryption and client cert authentication from servers perspective.

2. private key is used for decrypting its used for client cert authentication from clients perspective.


Keystore / Truststore

used to hold only your public/private key pair

Truststore
used to hold clients public keys
used to hold server public keys if communicating with server over https




Encryption
From App Server Perspective
Configure an http listener with SSL ( https)

From Client Perspective
From Browser



in glassfish we create a domain :
D:\programfiles\glassfish5\glassfish\domains\domain1\config
keystore.jks file 

this has a key pair generated automatically called s1as generated automatically when glassfish is started.



the client has to generate a key pair ( public, private)
then client has to export the public key

app server has to import the client public key into the truststore and configure http listener with this information.
