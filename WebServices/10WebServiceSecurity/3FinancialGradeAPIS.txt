In many cases, Fintech services such as aggregation services use screen scraping and stores user passwords. This model is both brittle and insecure. To cope with the brittleness, it should utilize an API model with structured data and to cope with insecurity, it should utilize a token model such as OAuth [RFC6749, RFC6750].

This working group aims to rectify the situation by developing a REST/JSON model protected by OAuth. Specifically, the FAPI WG aims to provide JSON data schemas, security and privacy recommendations and protocols to:

enable applications to utilize the data stored in the financial account,
enable applications to interact with the financial account, and
enable users to control the security and privacy settings.
Both commercial and investment banking account as well as insurance, and credit card accounts are to be considered.

What is FAPI?
Financial-grade API (FAPI), being standardized by a working group under OpenID Foundation (OIDF), aims “to provide specific implementation guidelines for online financial services to adopt by developing a REST / JSON data model protected by a highly secured OAuth profile” (source: OIDF).

FAPI Security Profiles
The FAPI Security Profiles are intended to be applied to online services in any sectors that requires a higher level of security than provided by standard OAuth or OpenID Connect. There are two types of profiles:

Financial-grade API - Part 1: Read-Only API Security Profile

An OAuth profile suitable for read-only API access to financial data and other similar use cases

Financial-grade API - Part 2: Read and Write API Security Profile

A security profile suitable for read and write API access to financial services and other similar situations where the risk is higher

The latter one, “FAPI Part 2,” provides higher security measures by leveraging advanced features defined in OpenID Connect specifications in addition to OAuth standards. Here are some notable enhancements:

Prevention of sender impersonation and message tampering in terms of authorization request and response
Using request object
Using hybrid flow or JARM
Prevention of leakage and unauthorized use of authorization code
Strict checking of Redirect URI (redirect_uri)
Prevention of client impersonation
Client authentication with mutual TLS client authentication or JWT
Prevention of unauthorized use of tokens
Using OAUTB (Token Binding) or Certificate-bound Token

Financial-grade API (FAPI), explained by an implementer

Financial-grade API (FAPI) is a technical specification that Financial-grade API Working Group of OpenID Foundation has developed. It uses OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) as its base and defines additional technical requirements for the financial industry and other industries that require higher security. […] This article explains Financial-grade API security profile.
