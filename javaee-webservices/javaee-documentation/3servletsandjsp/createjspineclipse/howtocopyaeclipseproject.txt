go to project explorer pane

right click on previous project, copy it and paste it to some location


then on the copied project ( new one ) go to project's properties

go to web project settings

and change the context path to what you named this project to 

so for example

servletprint was my project 1
so change it to servletprint2

this way the context paths are now changed

now when we run this new project, there will be no conflict of
the contextpaths.



so there will be no errors, else the app will not run
