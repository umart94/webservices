glassfish v5 works with jdk1.8.0_144
ssl will also work with this configuration


make eclipse.ini use jdk jdk1.8.0_172


in glassfish configuration, xml file make note of the ports being used

if some other application is using that port,

glassfish will give errors like :

1. connection closed
2. ioexception
3. cannot set the error page

so disable the services on those ports or change glassfish port.



also the username password that you set with your configuration will be required

if that is incorrect, glassfish will not start..

we will need to allow the security exception on browser, since ssl certificate is self signed.


afterwards the glassfish config page should show..



it will give a few errors... since we created a new project and it takes time for all the classes to load...


so for this, either refresh the page... or wait for the wsdl and tester files to load 

or refresh then click on them again..
