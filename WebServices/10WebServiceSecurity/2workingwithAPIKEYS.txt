API Key : arbitrary string issued to web developer by web service provider that developer includes in web service requests.

the api key is received by web service provider as a part of the request and compared to a data store on the server to authenticate the request

by design they are very hard to spoof.

-------------------------------------
for large scale applications we need a license from the api key provider. ( web service provider)

1. indicate which services we want to use
2. we need to be authenticated to the web service provider for api key

if we are making requests from web browsers / web clients we already have the api key so we can start making requests using this key
