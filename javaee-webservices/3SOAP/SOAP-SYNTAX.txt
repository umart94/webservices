Envelope
this is a container for the document that identifies it as a soap message
this element is required in order to inform the recipient on how to use the document
as opposed to just an oridinary  xml doc.

optional header contains descriptive metadata for the main document
this is not required
but its been official to aid in searching or modifying large soap messages

the body is the most important part
it contains all of the calls and responses
this defines the actual function of the soap message

finally it is possible to define error checking through a fault element
this is a diagnostic tool for sender to see anything that goes wrong during recipients processing of the message

Envelope tag, put reference to the envelope
the url refers to another webservice, that defines the envelope used in a soap message.

Header
beginning of the header- header blocks inside the header are application defined, and they can be inserted with the header tag format
fixed tags that can be used to change how the soap message can be extended.

soap provides limited encodingStyles that must be followed.

role tag specifies which nodes are allowed to  process which parts of the header block.
roles are defined by uri
using them you can specify a particular website
or computer that is allowed to execute a certain header block rather than have it be executed by all nodes

e.g
http://w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/next - tells all nodes in the message path to examine the header block

http://w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/ultimateReceiver - only the ultimateReceiving node will be able to examine the header.

mustUnderstand tag designates whether a node is required to process a specific header block. this is a method of error checking
because setting 
mustUnderstand=true, requires every node to either process the block correctly and completely or throw a false.
mustUnderstand=false, node will attempt to process a block, but if it fails to do so then it will move on to the next one without throwing an error  

env relay , determines whether a node should remove a header block from a soap message after processing it
this is useful if we want a specific header block to only be processed once by a single node and then never used again.


within the body tag, we can include the actual message to be transferred.

fault tag has a unique identifier for the fault
and an explanation for error and identifier as to which node caused the fault.
