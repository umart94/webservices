pre-webservice transport protocols
EDI : phone lines, telex machines, telnet, bi-directional modems
---------------
XML in 1998
------------
Non-HTTP Transport protocols
FTP (File transfer protocol)
- well suited for long documents
- web service using ftp is called asynchronous, meaning that PCs arent communicating in realtime.

INSTEAD :

Client(I) ----- FTP Server(II) ------ Provider(III)

1. client requests to FTP server ( client may upload files)
2. responsing computer, which is the web service provider(III) (not ftp server(II)) will only discover the message when it polls a Dropbox folder ( set in config settings)
it would then create a response document. and place it in an OUTGOING folder. and the client will also periodically poll for messages.

so in FTP client these folders are set on the 2 PCs. with authentication settings, and web-service using ftp uses polling requests and response documents.

it can support very large file transfers and message deliveries.

----------------
SMTP AND POP
Simple Mail Transfer PROTOCOL
Post Office Protocol.

Document storage is on central hub server.

Client --- SMTP Server ------ Provider. ( data is not directly sent, but polling is done through folders.)

-----------------
HyperText Transfer Protocol

Document Storage usually on the web service provider
support synchronous request/response conversations.


Client ---------- request and wait -------------------> provider
client <------------- immediate response --------------- provider
