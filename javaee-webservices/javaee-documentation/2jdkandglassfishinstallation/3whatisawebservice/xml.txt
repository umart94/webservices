self-descriptive
tags defined by author


<!-- root tag is message, when this root tag is closed document is finished. -->

<!-- this ensures that computers can quickly determine the start and end points of a file -->

the structure is that of an html document - in html the tags are predefined.

difference in xml is that the tags are custom made 

<root>
<message id="123">
<p>All text added to this tag is considered a part of this tag</p>
</message>
</root>

p was last tag used innermost element.
p must be closed before its parent was closed.

tags and attributes are case sensitive.
