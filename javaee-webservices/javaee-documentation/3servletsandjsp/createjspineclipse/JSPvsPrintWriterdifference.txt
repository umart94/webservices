before we used printwriter to output html

now , the user wants to fetch the JSP page


so 

the SERVLET class will forward the HTTPServletRequest to the JSP page.

and the JSP Page will be sent in the response.


The ResquestDispatcher is used for this purpose :

The ResquestDispatcher Defines an object that receives requests from the client and sends them to any resource (such as a servlet, HTML file, or JSP file) on the server. The servlet container creates the RequestDispatcher object, which is used as a wrapper around a server resource located at a particular path or given by a particular name.
This interface is intended to wrap servlets, but a servlet container can create RequestDispatcher objects to wrap any type of resource.


the request is what the client sends to the servlet.
we obtain the requestdispatcher object from the request.


RequestDispatcher view = request.getRequestDispatcher("WEB-INF/views/testdisplay.jsp");

the argument to request dispatcher is the jsp page we want to send as response.


import requestdispatcher from javax.servlet... and not glassfish :D


		view.forward(request,response);
the request will be from client end browser.
the view, is what we obtained above using request dispatcher.

we forward the request 

forward(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)
Forwards a request from a servlet to another resource (servlet, JSP file, or HTML file) on the server.

the request is now on JSP page.

jsp will write html to response

browser gets back the html written to response by the JSP VIEW.
