Security and Encryption

1. Enable Security Manager:
in configuration - server config - security - enable security manager

we need to apply the security to and from web service


the most common security is web services security which uses xml encryption and xml digital signatures to secure messages

Security -> Message Security:

the two types of security configurations describe the web services

HttpServlet
is designed for restful web services, and web services that communicate primarily through http

SOAP
is designed for soap web services


click on http servlet
Specify default server and client provider configuration. Selecting the blank option configures a null provider.

we have to specify a configuration for client side and server side security

by default
http servlet only has 1 security option
setting the default provider with GFConsoleAuthModule.
choosing this causes the server side to use basic authentication to encrypt data and control access.

SOAP has 2 options
ServerProvider
XWS_ServerProvider

both of them provide same security
xws has additional security for xml files.



Points:

Authentication - who is accessing the service ( username,password)
Authorization - who can access the service, prevents unauthorized users to access the system. ( username,password)
multiple players of authorization

administrators view any parts
clients access certain parts. etc.


Confidentiality - ensure that no one else can eavesdrop on the connection

who can see messages to and from the service.

encryption standard

public and private keys
