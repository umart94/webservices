we will go to localhost:8080 , thats the website / (webserver)

the application context root is servletprint 

so when users will go to our website, they will first go to servletprint.

then through links, we go to SEPERATE SERVLETS URL PATHS.


so these are like seperate web pages.

any  java class that extends HttpServlet must implement the doGet method

and doPost method

(see the abstract classes methods to be implemented for class HttpServlet)


the doGet method is called, for the GET request on the servlet.


in these webservices project, system.out.println will print to the console.


but for displaying html output on the webpage, we use PrintWriter class.


we will obtain the HTTP GET REQUEST from the client through HttpServletRequest , AND A HTTP RESPONSE through HttpServletResponse



make sure that when you run a newly coded application you undeploy the previous web apps from


glassfish management
deployed applications

right click on each app
select undeploy.
