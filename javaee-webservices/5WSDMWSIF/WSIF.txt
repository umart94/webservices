Web Services Invocation Framework

java api for web services description language
alternative for soap apis

alternative to soap

interact with representation of services

work with variety of web services

not all web services written in soap

wsif allows us to add binding extensions ( more binding support than soap)

major strengths 

Multiple bindings
Dynamic Invocation

we dont have to statically type the binding
what binding the other service uses, program will check it and choose a binding type dynamically on runtime


single instance of web service
soap bindings
local bindings 

quickly reimplement web service
api calls are technologically independent.
