REST Goals:

scalability
generality of interfaces
independent deployment of components

REST Messages:

request -> URIs with parameters.

depends on service specification.

we change and customize. rest is not that much strict on the xml rules that soap had.

parameters are also in body of the format.

Popular XML-based Formats : 
Custom like Plain Old XML POX
