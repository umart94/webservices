when why and to what extend we should optimize our java code

significant disadvantages

code is harder to understand and maintain
flexibility to update code and maintain code
compatibility issues


10 % of the code takes 90 5 of the time

never repeat work
database accesses are slow.

assigned to a variable. in place of a calculation

web services - LIMIT THE AMMOUNT OF DATABASE ACCESSES.
external servers take milliseconds instead of microseconds.


structure data in usable form
nesting loops - highly inefficient

ordering of data can optimize  code.

if we have 1 million unordered pieces of data - takes 1 million operations

if they are sorted. searching for value takes just 20 operations using binary search.
