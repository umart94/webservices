http methods
target processes request
returns output in xml and json

rest uses a different format for sending vs receiving requests.


RESTful methods

1. get 

GET /users/name HTTP/1.1

first part is the GET method
second part is the directory structure
finally http/1.1 tells what format we are using to write the message.

the complete get request would look like this :

GET /users/name HTTP/1.1
Host: servername
Accept: text/xml


GET /users/adduser?username=name HTTP/1.1
retrieve the username and add user in a single request.

get put and delete requests are supposed to be idempotent

running the request again with the same parameters should cause no further change.

only the post method is not idempotent.
post method can make further changes.





2. put






3. post
change accept to content-type

POST /users/name HTTP/1.1
Host: servername
Content-Type: text/xml

<?xml version="1.0">
<tag name="example">
<data/>
</tag>


4. delete
