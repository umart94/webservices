SOAP , REST , OData
Web Service Standards.
-----------------------

1. SOAP [ the format]
foundation of WS-* standards. (Web Service Everything)
Service Oriented Architecture.
originally championed by microsoft.
Remote Object Proxy Engine.
managed by w3c since 2001

The role of SOAP Toolkits.
called functions called operations
defined by service being used.
resulting code looks like code they call in local environment.


SOAP Library implementation (1 on client and 1 on server)

soap was used in early 2000s.

SOAP was very verbose
lots of attributes and annotations
it required more text

also the engines that parse soap messages vary.


SOAP not good for mobiles.
BUT
SOAP has good standards for security and enterprise development.

----------------------------

2. RESTful ( mid 2000s)

REST -- Representational State Transfer. (Roy Fielding)

it is an architecture, not just a message format.
http actions and requests are mapped to server side restful requests. similiarly each request has a verb and we can use many message formats.

1. Stateless : each request is independent.
2. Cacheable: results can be cached on client to reduce transactions.

REST better for mobiles ( any web service that returns json message formats, due to the smaller size of json)
----------------------------

3. OData (a RESTful Standard) - based on REST

send OData requests in form of URIs and get data back in parsable form.

OData has strict data rules.
choose between xml and json.

------------------------------
Other WebService Standards.

XML-RPC : XML REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL

UDDI : UNIVERSAL DISCOVERY AND DESCRIPTION

WSDL : WEB SERVICE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE.

WSDM : WEB SERVICE DISTRIBUTED MANAGEMENT.
