4 steps jax-rs api

Step-1 : 

javax.ws.rs.client.Client interface

Client c = ClientBuilder.newClient()

Step-2 : 

Assign the client to a target uri using client.target command
this tells the client where to look for target command
similiar to a method call in java
method could be in another computer or server

c.target(URI)

Uri will be different
just on computer
or hosted on another server


Step- 3 :

Create a request

.request(MediaType.type)

syntax is different
text/xml , text/plain

type that will be requiresd


step -4 :

invoke the request

get post put or delete

for e.g

.get(String.class) // get is commonly a string, so we put String.class

but for put post or delete we will have to put the specific mime type.. to specify the input and not the output.
