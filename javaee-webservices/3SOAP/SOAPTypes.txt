released may 2000
based on XML 1.0, which is a specific type of serialization
only supports http
supported by JAX-WS
not compatible with soap 1.2

soap 1.1 error checking
available tags

<faultcode> - uniquely identifies the fault
<faultstring> - error message seen by a human
<faultactor> - identifier for the node that created the fault
<detail> - application specific error information related to the body element





----------------------
v 1.2
june 2003
based on xml information set - which provides a way to describe an xml document
but does not necessarily serialize the document with xml 1.0

as a result, soap 1.2 can use other serialization formats. such as a binary protocol format which can be more compact than a 
soap 1.1 message.

supports any protocol that conforms to its framework
tcpip etc.
supported by JAX-WS

compatible with soap 1.1 (backwards compatible)
(however, some features may not be available in 1.1)

in soap 1.2
<detail> - application specific error information related to the body element - this tag remains same as in 1.1
<faultcode> replaced with <Code>
<faultstring> replaced with <Reason>
<faultactor> replaced with <Node>

<Role> - a completely new element
this indicates the role the node was playing when fault occured.
